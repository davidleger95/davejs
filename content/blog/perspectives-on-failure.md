Working for a startup, I see myself and coworkers experience failure almost on a daily basis. And sometimes they’re hard to reconcile. Like shipping a bug to production that broke user login for five days before we noticed. Or entirely scrapping a project that people put months of work into just days after launch. These failures are not small and they happen often enough that before we can even process one failure, another one is likely sneaking up behind us.

We’re all familiar with the concept of learning from our failures. It’s something we’re told from an early age. For me, this feels like a coping mechanism for our biggest fuck-ups. We tell our selves _this is a learning opportunity_ and move on, often without feeling like we’ve learned anything. It seems healthy to approach failure with positivity. But I think we wrongly assume that there is some epiphany to be realized every time we fail, if only we just searched hard enough. In reality, sometimes failures are just wasted time, effort, money, what have you; and with little to of value to gain from it and our resilience to failure— ironically — fails.

It’s common for failures to compound and bring people to a breaking point. I’ve seen coworkers struggle with the stress of failure to the point of burn out and sometimes quitting. These people aren’t weak-willed — they’re actually some of the strongest and smartest people I’ve ever worked with. This has led me to realize that my own strategy for reconciling failure is not a common one.

I’m not entirely sure where I picked this up, but having this perspective has guided me through many tough times in my education and career:

> The first ten times you do something, expect to fail.

At first glance, this might feel discouraging. Why should we do something that we’re expecting not to work? What I’ve found though is that I’ve started to frame solving problems as a series of experiments, where the more experiments you try, the more likely it is one will succeed. This has also enabled me to take more risks.

> It’s important to ask yourself: Is there a lesson worth learning from this failure?

An important part of my perspective is that I don’t romanticize about finding a silver lining or learning from each and every failure. It’s important to ask yourself: Is there a lesson worth learning from this failure? There is a real opportunity cost. Every moment spent trying to learn from a tough failure is one that could be spent increasing the chances of success.
