Working for a startup, I see myself and coworkers experience failure almost on a daily basis. Sometimes these failures are hard to reconcile. For instance, entirely scrapping a project that people put months of work into just days after launch. Failures like this are not small and they happen often enough that before we can even process one failure, another one is likely sneaking up behind us.

In a work environment like a startup, it’s common for failures to compound and bring people to a breaking point. I’ve seen coworkers struggle with the stress of failure to the point of burn out and sometimes even quitting. These people aren’t weak-willed nor incapable of handing stress — they’re actually some of the strongest, smartest, and most resilient people I’ve ever worked with.

This has led me to realize that my own strategy for reconciling failure is not all that common. So I’d like to share my perspective on failure and maybe it’ll be helpful to you.

### Everything is an Experiment

I’m not entirely sure where I picked this up, but maintaining this perspective has guided me through many tough failures. To get myself in this mindset, I tell myself:

> The first ten times you do something, expect to fail.

At first, this might feel discouraging. Why bother doing something that we’re expecting not to work? What I’ve found though is that this helps to frame solving problems as a series of disposable experiments. At this point maybe you’re wondering _why ten?_ The number is actually arbitrary, but it’s a number that’s large enough so, by the time I get to it, I no longer care how many attempts I’ve made. Pick 50, or 100, if that’s a better number for you.

### Output vs. Process

When everything is an experiment, what I’ve noticed is that it prevents any emotional attachment to the output of my work. If months of my work turns out to be useless, it doesn’t bother me because I’ve already decided it’s disposable. But as someone who is passionate about the work I do, my emotions are what motivate me. So how does that work?

> Become passionate about the process — not your output.

Shifting focus from the output to the process of running experiments has allowed me to stay passionate about my work, while not exposing myself to the negativity of failure. Become passionate about the process — not your output. Let the tangible results of your work be a byproduct of the process.

### Learning Opportunities

We’re all familiar with the concept of learning from our failures. It’s something we’re told from an early age. For me, this feels like a coping mechanism for our biggest fuck-ups. We tell our selves _this is a learning opportunity_ and move on, often without feeling like we’ve learned anything. It seems healthy to approach failure with positivity. But I think we wrongly assume that there is some epiphany to be realized every time we fail, if only we just searched hard enough. In reality, sometimes failures are just wasted time, effort, money, what-have-you; and with little to of value to gain from it and our resilience to failure — ironically — fails.

> It’s important to ask yourself: Is there a lesson worth learning from this failure?

An important part of my perspective is that I don’t romanticize about finding a silver lining or learning from each and every failure. It’s important to ask yourself: Is there a lesson worth learning from this failure? There is a real opportunity cost here. Every moment spent trying to learn from a tough failure is one that could be spent increasing the chances of success.

These strategies have helped me maintain a healthy relationship with failure. However, it can be easy to lose sight of these sometimes. I think it’s good to have as many strategies as possible for coping with failure, and there’s always the possibility that my perspective is not the best one. So let me know, what strategies have you found useful for putting failure into perspective?
