In a previous post, I shared my [perspective on failure](/perspectives-on-failure/). I emphasized the lasting negative impact failure can have on us. It can be overwhelming and lead to undue stress if not managed well.

However, at the very least failure is explicit. It can come in the form of a poor performance review from a manager. A missed deadline. Another person being angry with us. And notably from these examples, our realization of failure is typically forced upon us though means out of our control.

Although it can be tough to handle, knowledge of failure gives us permission to move beyond it. It's a bit of a blessing in disguise. Failure is short-term pain that can be the spark that propels us to long-term success.

> A mild success is a failure in disguise.

Equally, if not more than failure, we should be wary of mild successes. A mild success is a failure in disguise. It seeds of regret. It's settling for _good enough_ when we are capable of so much more.

Mild successes have associated opportunity costs that can lead us to sink months, years, or even a lifetime of effort into things we'd rather not spend our time doing.

Perhaps you stay at a job you're satisfied with and pays well. Meanwhile, a job you'd enjoy far more and pays better is out there. But your current job, although not the greatest, it pays the bills and keeps you comfortable. So you never notice new opportunities or apply for them, and better jobs slip by time and time again. This is one I've seen happen far too often to friends and family.

So how do we deal with these mild successes? I think it's important to be proactive in identifying when we've achieved a mild success. Identify it. And kill it. 

> In order to achieve something we love, we must abandon the things we merely like.

In writing, aspiring authors are told: _kill your darlings_. This can be more broadly applied to many facets of our life. In order to achieve something we love, we must abandon the things we merely like, along with the attention and care they require. Although mild successes can make us happy, they can cause us to stagnate and settle for what's comfortable, preventing us from chasing what's desirable.

In my earlier example, I described a mediocre job impeding your path to a better one. Surely I'm not advocating for you to quit your comfortable job before finding a better one, right? Well actually... why not? Seriously. Ask yourself, _would I be better off quitting my job and dedicating all my attention and effort to improving my skills and applying for a job I actually love?_

For most people, the answer will be no, which is fine. (That is my answer.) But for some, it will be yes.

That is just one example though. The chances are, if you apply this line of questioning to other parts of your life, you'll find at least one darling worth killing.

Happy hunting. ðŸ”ª
